# Statistical Analysis of Salt Flooding on Juvenile Maritime Tree Species

Maritime coastal forestsâ€™ proximity to the ocean makes these trees vulnerable to climate change. Rising sea level and frequent storms have been a relevant topic in the impact on maritime trees. To understand how coastal forests are impacted by rising sea level and the frequency of storms, we will analyze two greenhouse experiments. The first experiment used 16 trees from each species all at different levels of salinity. There were four levels of salinity: the control with 0 ppt, 5 ppt, 10 ppt, and 15 ppt. The second experiment used nine trees from each species all at different frequency levels. Monthly rates of flooding were determined by flooding in the mid-Atlantic coast in 2019 and the predicted flooding rates in 2030 and 2045.
