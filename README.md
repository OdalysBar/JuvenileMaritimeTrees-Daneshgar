# Statistical Analysis of Salt Flooding on Juvenile Maritime Tree Species

Maritime coastal forestsâ€™ proximity to the ocean makes these trees vulnerable to climate change. Rising sea level and frequent storms have been a relevant topic in the impact on maritime trees. To understand how coastal forests are impacted by rising sea level and the frequency of storms, we will analyze two greenhouse experiments. 
1. We used 16 trees from 9 different species all at different levels of salinity (control group 0 ppt, 5 ppt, 10 ppt, and 15 ppt).
2. We used nine trees from 9 different species all at different frequency levels. Monthly rates of flooding were determined by flooding in the mid-Atlantic coast in 2019 and the predicted flooding rates in 2030 and 2045.
